Cameron Clarke sits on the floor, stomach open, fingers twitching. You feel remorse. Mr Clarke was a good man in his years of poetry.
You see, after Cameron won second place in the competition, he felt anger and frustration. In the end, he decided life did not deserve 'Black Boys Play the Classics' and resorted to a new life without pain or suffering. No second place, no poetry. Just an eternity of IKEA meatballs. That was all he wanted... But with selfish choices, come consequences. In return for his endless supply of meatballs, he turned into what he is now; a sack of flesh where the meatballs manifested into the infectious spores that turned the English.
Now, you sit beneath the dying sun that sinks under the horizon. You left the world as a better place. The zombies are gone, the world is safe, and the IKEA Meatball Industry will be fired.
Everything turns to darkness...
