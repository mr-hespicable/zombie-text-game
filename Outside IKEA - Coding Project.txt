You warily take a step outside.
With every step taken, your energy level decreases as if it were being poured out of you. All you want is some food... Some IKEA meatballs sound good right now, but that is too far away if you want to remain alive. Your mouth feels dry. You know you can't take any chances with the water; it is only too likely that it is infected.
Now, you hear the nightmarish complaints of the 'things' only a few yards away.
'Bloody forei-foreigners!' they groan.
Once again, you get up for the final stand to reach the signal tower.
