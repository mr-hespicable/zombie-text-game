Your trembling legs turn and walk away. You slip through the sliding doors, and you meet with the outer world once more. The dying light fades under the emerging darkness in the sky. You feel guilty for leaving Mr Clarke to rot away in the signal tower.
That's when you hear it... The ominous rumble of the tower.
The weight of poor Cameron must have been too much for the foundations. A large crack emerges from the bottom of the tower, running up the concrete.
It falls.
Now you regret your decisions. You were wrong, you failed, you couldn't do it, you were always doomed to die like this - with pain and suffering and guilt for not being there for your dear friend Cameron.
The looming shadow grows bigger to swallow you whole...
