Chapter 1

You run downstairs and realize you are in the dark. You cannot see anything. You can hear noises above, and they sound like zombies. Luckily, you are below ground. You stumble on something and fall over. You realize it was a brick and keep walking. After a few steps, you hit a wall. You look to your left and see another passage. You tap the wall and find it is hollow. 

Which do you choose?

You can either try and break down the wall with the brick and find out what is behind it
OR
You can keep walking.

You go back for the brick and start breaking down the wall. You successfully break down the wall, only to find it is a zombie colony! You try to run but they catch your legs. You are dragged back into the colony and eaten alive.

Would you like to go back and try again?

You can either try and break down the wall with the brick and find out what is behind it
OR
You can walk down the passage and try and keep walking.

You decide to keep walking you hear footsteps above and hope that they don't start digging. The deeper you go the more undergrowth you find. 
You eventually arrive at a door with a red light above it. You realize the door has exposed wiring that could electrocute you if you touch the door with bare skin. You could try and divert the current to a different wire and potentially allowing you to safely exit the door.

Which do you choose?

Divert the current 
OR
Risk opening the door

You choose to risk opening the door. You take a few steps back and put your shoulder forward. You run into the door and fall through with a numb shoulder. In front of you sits the basement of an office building.
You choose to divert the current. You walk over to the wiring and try diverting the current. You twist the wires and join them together. You have made the door safe to open! 
You open the door and, after many hours in the dark, you emerge into the basement of an office building.

Chapter 2

You continue walking, hands outstretched in a dark and ominous surrounding. You see a door with light pooling in from the cracks. Your foot kicks something which skids just ahead of you. You walk blindly towards and pick it up. You recognise it as a handgun. 
You also see something reflecting the light. You tread towards it, carefully. You realize it is a throwing knife.

Which do you choose?

The handgun with limited ammo but longer range
OR
The throwing you can collect from bodies but with limited range

You choose the handgun. Good choice!

You choose the throwing knife. Good choice!

You go up the stairs and open the door. There is a zombie waiting outside the door! It runs toward you. You point the gun at its head and fire at it once! Twice! The zombie goes down. It must have been infected recently. They usually do not go down that easily. 
You look around and you see a sign with two big yellow letters IK. The rest of the sign is gone but you can tell you have arrived at the IKEA warehouse! Your final destination! 
You are nearly there, but there is still a while to go before you reach the signal tower.
You are on the ground floor, and you need to get to the roof,
You can either...

Run up the escalator and hope you are not seen
OR
Try the elevator and hope that it is not broken

You choose the elevator. You walk over to the panel and click the UP button. The doors groan open and out jumps a zombie. It leaps on top of you, pinning you to the ground. You hold it back and reach for your gun, but the zombie pushes it out your hand, but only a few centimetres away. 
You can either...

Try and push it off and run for the escalator.
OR
You can reach for your gun and risk holding off the zombie with one hand.

Which do you choose?

You choose to push it off and run. You push it off, momentarily stunning it. But the zombie is fast and catches up quickly.
